**Lexis** is a vocabulary-builder desktop app, which helps to organize a library of words to learn.
The app provides means to group words by subject together with choosing a picture representing a word.
An audio with the pronunciation of a word is also generated.
In case dictionary doesn't provide any meaning for the word or phrase, you may add it yourself into the library.
